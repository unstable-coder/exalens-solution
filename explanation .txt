This code appears to be a function that helps someone find an apartment block that meets a set of requirements. It takes in two arguments:

blocks: an array of objects, where each object represents an apartment block and has keys for various amenities (e.g., gym, pool, etc.)
reqs: an array of strings, where each string represents a required amenity
The function first initializes two variables: minDistance, which will keep track of the minimum distance from an apartment block to the nearest
block with a required amenity, and optimalBlock, which will keep track of the apartment block with the minimum distance.

Then, the function loops through each block in the blocks array. For each block, it calculates the maximum distance to the nearest
block with a required amenity by looping through the reqs array and using the findDistance function to calculate the distance to the 
nearest block with the current required amenity. It updates the maxDistance variable if the current distance is larger.

Finally, the function checks whether the current block's maxDistance is smaller than the current minDistance. If it is, the function 
updates minDistance to the current block's maxDistance and optimalBlock to the current block's index.

The findDistance function calculates the distance to the nearest block with a given amenity by looping through the blocks to the right 
and left of the current block and returning the smallest distance to a block with the amenity. If it finds a block with the amenity, it breaks out of the loop.

Overall, the apartmentHunting function finds the apartment block that is closest to the nearest block with each required amenity.
